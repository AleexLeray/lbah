### How to compile
1. First, to get all the development dependencies, do this:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

2. Now to compile everything needed by the project (for now it compiles .ts, .scss and .pug):
   ```sh
   npm run default
   ``` 

You can also use the available watchers which are:
* SCSS:

```sh
npm run watch_sass
```
* TypeScript:

```sh
npm run watch
```
