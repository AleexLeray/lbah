### How to compile
1. First, run ```sh npm install``` to get all the development dependencies.
2. Now you can run ```sh npm run default``` which will compile everything needed by the project (for now it compiles .ts, .scss and .pug).

You can also use the available watchers which are:
* SCSS: ```sh npm run watch_sass```
* TypeScript: ```sh npm run watch```
